   cd Bolt
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Add your API keys (Supabase, OpenAI, Stripe)
   ```

3. **Set up database**
   ```bash
   # Run database/setup.sql in your Supabase project
   ```

4. **Seed knowledge base**
   ```bash
   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   
   # Seed the knowledge base (in another terminal)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge-base/seed \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"adminKey": "your-admin-key"}'
   ```

5. **Experience the AI assistant**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000`
   - Try queries like:
     - "How do I create a subscription with a trial period?"
     - "Walk me through a complete onboarding workflow"
     - "I need a tutorial on multi-tenant architecture"

## 🧠 AI Assistant Examples

### Stripe Integration Help
```
User: "How do I handle failed payments securely?"

Bolt: "I'll guide you through a comprehensive payment recovery workflow:

**Immediate Response (Day 0)**
- Send payment failed notification with retry link
- Maintain service access temporarily
- Update customer payment method

Here's the secure implementation:
[Provides working code examples with security warnings]

**Key Security Considerations:**
⚠️ Always verify webhook signatures
⚠️ Use HTTPS for all payment endpoints  
⚠️ Never store card details directly

Would you like me to show you the complete dunning workflow implementation?"
```

### Architecture Guidance
```
User: "What's the best multi-tenant database strategy?"

Bolt: "For multi-tenant SaaS, I recommend three approaches based on your needs:

**1. Row-Level Security (RLS) - Best for most SaaS**
- Single database with tenant_id filtering
- Cost-effective with good isolation
- PostgreSQL RLS policies handle security automatically

**2. Schema-per-Tenant - For enhanced isolation**
- Separate schemas in shared database  
- Better security, moderate complexity
- Good for compliance requirements

**3. Database-per-Tenant - Maximum isolation**
- Complete separation per tenant
- Highest security, highest operational cost
- Best for enterprise/regulated industries

Based on your current setup, I'd recommend starting with RLS. 
Would you like me to show you the implementation?"
```

### Interactive Tutorials
```
User: "I need a tutorial on building a subscription system"

Bolt: "Perfect! I have a comprehensive 4-6 hour tutorial that covers:

**What You'll Build:**
✅ Customer onboarding flow
✅ Plan selection and pricing  
✅ Trial periods and conversions
✅ Billing portal integration

**Prerequisites Check:**
- Basic Stripe integration ✓
- Database setup (I can help with this)
- Authentication system ✓

Ready to start? I'll guide you through each step with working code, 
security tips, and testing strategies. 

Should we begin with the customer onboarding flow?"
```
